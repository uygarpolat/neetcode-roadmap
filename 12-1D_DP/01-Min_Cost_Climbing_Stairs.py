Min Cost Climbing Stairs

https://neetcode.io/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs?list=neetcode150
 
You are given an array of integers cost where cost[i] is the cost of taking a step from the ith floor of a staircase. After paying the cost, you can step to either the (i + 1)th floor or the (i + 2)th floor.

You may choose to start at the index 0 or the index 1 floor.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase, i.e. just past the last index in cost.

Example 1:

Input: cost = [1,2,3]

Output: 2
Explanation: We can start at index = 1 and pay the cost of cost[1] = 2 and take two steps to reach the top. The total cost is 2.

Example 2:

Input: cost = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1]

Output: 4
Explanation: Start at index = 0.

Pay the cost of cost[0] = 1 and take two steps to reach index = 2.
Pay the cost of cost[2] = 1 and take two steps to reach index = 4.
Pay the cost of cost[4] = 1 and take two steps to reach index = 6.
Pay the cost of cost[6] = 1 and take one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 4.
Constraints:

2 <= cost.length <= 100
0 <= cost[i] <= 100
