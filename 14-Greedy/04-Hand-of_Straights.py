Hand of Straights

https://neetcode.io/problems/hand-of-straights?list=neetcode150

You are given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize.

You want to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and card values are consecutively increasing by 1.

Return true if it's possible to rearrange the cards in this way, otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,4,2,3,5,3,4], groupSize = 4

Output: true
Explanation: The cards can be rearranged as [1,2,3,4] and [2,3,4,5].

Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7], groupSize = 4

Output: false
Explanation: The closest we can get is [1,2,3,4] and [3,5,6,7], but the cards in the second group are not consecutive.

Constraints:

1 <= hand.length <= 1000
0 <= hand[i] <= 1000
1 <= groupSize <= hand.length
