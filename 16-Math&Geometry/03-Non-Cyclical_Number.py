Non-Cyclical Number

https://neetcode.io/problems/non-cyclical-number?list=neetcode150

A non-cyclical number is an integer defined by the following algorithm:

Given a positive integer, replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the above step until the number equals 1, or it loops infinitely in a cycle which does not include 1.
If it stops at 1, then the number is a non-cyclical number.
Given a positive integer n, return true if it is a non-cyclical number, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: n = 100

Output: true
Explanation: 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

Example 2:

Input: n = 101

Output: false
Explanation:
1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 2
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
1^2 + 6^2 = 37
3^2 + 7^2 = 58
5^2 + 8^2 = 89
8^2 + 9^2 = 145
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42
4^2 + 2^2 = 20
2^2 + 0^2 = 4 (This number has already been seen)

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
